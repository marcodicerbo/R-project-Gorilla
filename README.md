INTRODUCTION
This project builds on the scientific paper "Social groups buffer maternal loss in mountain gorillas," using a smaller dataset and simplified analyses compared to those reported in the original paper. Mountain gorilla orphans remain in stable, cohesive social groups, strengthening relationships after maternal loss.
Most mammals are entirely dependent on their mothers after birth, providing them with nourishment, thermoregulation, and protection. Maternal loss at a young age has dramatic consequences for survival. Furthermore, when orphaned individuals reach adulthood, they often suffer negative effects, such as reduced reproductive success or lower social status, as, in some species (especially social species with slow life histories), mothers continue to provide benefits to their co-resident offspring. In humans, if a child loses its mother, relatives, friends, and the wider community may take over. This doesn't tend to happen in nature. Even our closest relatives, chimpanzees, are much less likely to survive if their mothers die before they reach adolescence. 
While orphan survival is not the norm for mammals, humans may not be entirely unique.
Mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei Matschie, 1914, one of two subspecies of the eastern gorilla) generally live in stable family groups, usually with a dominant male and one or more females who care for their offspring for 8 to 15 years.
This study explored the possibility that gorillas provide community support to orphans, which could cushion the costs of maternal loss, much as occurs in humans.
It is possible that the tendency to care for young orphans has its origins in our evolutionary past. Understanding this more deeply could provide clues to the social mechanisms that help overcome early life adversities and positively impact future health and survival.

The article hypothesized that gorillas may face greater fitness costs if they experience maternal loss at an early age, and that males may face greater costs from maternal loss than females due to their longer periods of mother-offspring co-residence (approximately 7 years longer for gorillas that disperse). Alternatively, cohesive and stable social groups of mountain gorillas may allow group members to socially buffer the social costs of maternal loss. In particular, dominant males may play crucial roles in buffering the social adversities faced by maternal orphans, as past research has demonstrated the strong bond between dominant males and young orphans.

My research, scaled down from the article in terms of both questions and analyses, focused on four main points:
1. To analyze whether there were differences in two different variables (ContactChange and ProximityChange, explained below) related to the sex of the orphans.
2. Analyze any differences, with respect to the same variables, among other individuals in the group related to social rank and age.
3. Verify whether there was a correlation between the variables and the kinship between orphans and other individuals in the group.
4. Verify whether there was a correlation between the variables and the orphans' agemates, that is, other individuals in the group with a comparable age to the orphans (within 2 years of age difference).
