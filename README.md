# R-project-Gorilla
This project builds on the scientific paper "Social groups buffer maternal loss in mountain gorillas," using a smaller dataset and simplified analyses compared to those reported in the original paper. Mountain gorilla orphans remain in stable, cohesive social groups, strengthening relationships after maternal loss.
